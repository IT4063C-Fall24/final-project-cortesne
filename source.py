# # Call Center Employee Burnout
# 
# ![Banner](./assets/banner.jpeg)

# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# 
# With the growth of ecommerce, call centers are receiving more calls and chats that ever before. The interactions will range from product inquiry, order status, return details, and much more. This creates more and more interactions and volume that the customers need to take, which can lead to back to back interactions. The amount of work can and has led to burnout. Therefore, the problem I am hoping to bring up are: what steps can we take to address employee burnout? By addressing the causes of burnout, it will improve employee retention, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce costs going towards training new agents. 

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# What are main factors contributing to burnout among agents?
# 
# How does the workload correlate with employee retention/turnover rates?
# 
# What adjustments can be made to help reduce burnout?
# 

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# 
# An answer would focus on addressing the barriers that cause employee burnout. For example, a line graph that tracks the number of agents who work from home and not quit. Or a heatmap that shows peak workload times in relation to burnout. 

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# The datasets that I am looking at are:
# - Employee Burnout
#     -This dataset is relevant to me because it provides a lot of information about factors that goes into burnout, such as work from home (WFM) status and mental fatigue. It has a wide set of information, that I believe I can get a lot of information from. With this dataset, I believe that I can make scatter and bar graphs to correlate factors in employee burnout. 
# 
# - Call-Center-Dataset
#     -With this dataset, it shows the type of call center, average handle time, and speed of answer. I believe with this dataset I can find a relationship with employee satisfaction and speed of answer/average handle time. I believe the higher speed of answer the lower the satisfaction rating, which will impact employee burnout.
# 
# - Employee Turnover
#     -With this dataset, I was able to fix it, so I can now pull the information. But, it also provides a lot of information. This set gives information about the type of customer relations employement, gender, and anxiety. I believe the anxiety and industry columns with be the main columns I use to help support other visuals. The data here can work with the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics, which will help determine the wage influence on the anxiety. For example, if a certain industry has a high turnover, high anxiety, and low wage, then it can help paint a bigger picture.
# 
# - Occupational Employment and Wage Statisitics, May 2023
#     -This dataset provides information about different wages of different areas within customer relations. I believe this will work to support the data in the other datasets.  
# 
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# - By looking at the data by state, I hope to get an understanding about the main factors of burnout are.

# ## Approach and Analysis
# *What is your approach to answering your project question?*
# *How will you use the identified data to answer your project question?*
# üìù <!-- Start Discussing the project here; you can add as many code cells as you need -->

# I will make graphs that will focus and highlight different factors. I imagine that there will be numerous factors that contribute to employee burnout. While I look into them, I want to determine and find out which one an employee could create a plan on ASAP to improve the work environment for their employee. For example, a burnout factor can be the interactions, such as the customers are rude. Unfortunately, there isn't anything an employer can do there. Therefore, I will analyze the data and see what can options exist to create short-term and long-term solutions.

##Since I am restarting my final, it is not super detailed yet. 
# However, I plan to look at the burnout rate and see how they relate to other areas,
#  such as the resource allocation and mental fatigure score.

# ## Resources and References
# *What resources and references have you used for this project?*
# I used Kaggle and the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Three of my datasets came from Kaggle, and with BLS, I got to customize of their reports on the site, which I pulled as a OES_Report.csv
