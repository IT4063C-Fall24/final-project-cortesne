    "By looking into this problem, I hope to further understand what barriers currently exist that is negatively impacting or preventing people from getting access to healthcare. Therefore, I hope to look further into the Iron Triangle to understand what can be done to improve the cost, quality, and access to care. By focusing on these barriers, it will help both the external and internal stakeholders within healthcare. The patients are the external, and the medical team are the internal stakeholders. By addressing the barriers, it will help ensure that more patients are able to get access to care, which will improve the public health, improve proactive care, and reduce reactive care. "
