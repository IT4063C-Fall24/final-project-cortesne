### Reflection
<!-- Edit the following section with your reflection -->

#### What went well? I believe that the final went well overall once I changed my topic. I believe that it is still very beginner, and it might not be very advanced. But, I think that it is easy to follow and easy to understand. 
#### What did not go well? My original idea did not go well. It was too big, and it was too difficult to find data.
#### What did you learn? I believe that I learned a lot about other factors that goes into call center burnout, and this final help solidified the material covered in this class.
#### What would you do differently next time? If I were to do this again, I would make sure that my idea is sound and that it isn't to vague. Additionally, I would make sure that I could easy use the datasets I found.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.
